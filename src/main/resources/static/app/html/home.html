SRIRAMA, LLC provides professional engineering services for projects ranging from intersection 

improvements to major highways with interchanges. We understand that every project has its own 

challenges and merits and realize that the issues commonly result from design, construction or quality 

control deficiencies. We research and track lessons learned from other projects - whether it is designed 

by us or projects designed by others. By keeping those lessons learned in mind and following a thorough 

quality control we believe most of the issues could be addressed during early stages of the project 

thereby resulting in a hassle-less project. A hassle-less project is liked by all and by itself markets for 

future opportunities.
