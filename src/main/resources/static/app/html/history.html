	<h1>Welcome to Dumpalapally History</h1>
	<p>Welcome to the Dumpalapally village website. This web site is
		intended to link together the people who belongs to our home village
		Dumpalapally and living elsewhere. This site is not meant for any
		commercial purpose. You might want to know what is happening in your
		home village, you might be wondering what your childhood friends are
		doing now. How successful are they in their lives. This site is not
		for those trivial reasons. We spent our childhood there, leading some
		successful life some where else.., Let us try to do something back to
		our home village.</p>
	<p>Dumpalapally is a very prosperous model village located 110 km
		from Hyderabad and 20 km from the busy commercial town of Siddipet in
		Medak district in Andhra Pradesh. In the picturesque harmony of dense
		green forests, in a nest of 7 Hills, 7 tranquil lakes, 7 glorious
		Hanuman Temples, 7 silent village foundation stones(saptanabhi shilas)
		lies this abode of art and architecture. Thus this village is
		glorified with number seven. Its cultural heritage dates back to the
		Kakatiya Dynasty.</p>
